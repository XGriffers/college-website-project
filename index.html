        <p>Welcome to The Rose and the Raven Inn, a log cabin situated along a dusty and secluded road.<br />
            Inside there is joyful music and a charming and friendly atmosphere. The inn itself<br />
            features darkened red drapes over the windows, massive oak pillars supporting the upper floor,<br />
            which houses the inn&#39;s hotel-like features, the inn lit with the warming glow of candles<br />
            in masterfully crafted wrought iron sconces and chandeliers, and a cozy hearth. Inside there<br />
            are also depictions of the now bar keep&#39;s past adventures. There is also plenty of seating available to
            accommodate the largest of parties.</p>
        <p>
            We offer hot food and frothy ale, rooms at reasonable prices, and live entertainment nearly every
            night.<br />
            The staff is hard-working and friendly, so feel free to stop by for a pint.</p>
