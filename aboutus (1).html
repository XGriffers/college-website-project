<p>The owner of the inn Mathias Connor was from the port of Ventarco, a goblin society with a<br/>
less than stable economy. Being from a harbor, Mathias grew up owning his own boat, sailing the<br/>
seven seas and stopping at any landmass that looked inviting to peruse the local eateries.<br/>
At the age of 49, Mathias decided to retire from adventuring and settle down with Gwen Lula,<br/>
a half-elf farm girl he met during his travels. It was then that Mathias decided to share his<br/>
travels with fellow tourists and anyone else who wanders into the establishment.</p>

<p>Roaming the countryside, Mathias and Gwen stumbled upon an abandoned log cabin and<br/>
decided to turn it into the inn known as the rose and the raven. The inn itself is lit solely by<br/>
candlelight with wrought iron sconces on the massive oak beams supporting the upper floors<br/>
with a fireplace along the wall. </p>

<p>The Inn owned and operated by Mathias who primarily runs the bar and kitchen, along with<br/>
the many waitresses he employs serves a variety of meals, from fish and bread to stews of all kinds.<br/>
The atmosphere is friendly, and there is typically live entertainment every day. The bar and kitchen<br/>
are open daily from sun up to sun down; there are a wide variety of rooms<br/>
available with the most lavish of them starting at a dollar per night. The rooms themselves<br/>
feature a large window overlooking the golden wheat fields and pristine river in the distance<br/>
and a wardrobe to store belongings for the night.</p>
